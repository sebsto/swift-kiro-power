# Swift Concurrency Agent Skill

Expert guidance for any AI coding tool that supports the [Agent Skills open format](https://agentskills.io/home) — safe concurrency, performance, and Swift 6+ migration.

Based on the comprehensive [Swift Concurrency Course](https://www.swiftconcurrencycourse.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=agent-skill&utm_campaign=swift-concurrency-skill), distilled into actionable, concise references for agents.

## Who this is for
- Teams migrating to Swift 6 / strict concurrency who need safe defaults and quick triage.
- Developers debugging data races, isolation errors, or flaky async tests.
- Anyone wanting performance-minded concurrency patterns (actors, tasks, Sendable, async streams).

## How to Use This Skill

### Option A: Using OpenSkills (recommended)
1) Install OpenSkills:  
   ```bash
   npm i -g openskills
   ```
2) `cd` into your project directory.  
3) Install this skill:  
   ```bash
   openskills install avdlee/Swift-Concurrency-Agent-Skill
   ```
4) Sync into your `AGENTS.md`:  
   ```bash
   openskills sync
   ```
5) Use the skill in your AI agent, for example:  
   > Use the swift concurrency skill and analyze the current project for Swift Concurrency improvements

### Option B: Manual install
1) **Clone** this repository.  
2) **Install or symlink** the `swift-concurrency/` folder following your tool’s official skills installation docs (see links below).  
3) **Use your AI tool** as usual and ask it to use the “swift-concurrency” skill for Swift Concurrency tasks.

#### Where to Save Skills

Follow your tool’s official documentation, here are a few popular ones:
- **Codex:** [Where to save skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/#where-to-save-skills)
- **Claude:** [Using Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#using-skills)
- **Cursor:** [Enabling Skills](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills#enabling-skills)

**How to verify**: 

Your agent should reference the triage/playbook in `swift-concurrency/SKILL.md` and jump into the relevant reference file for your error or task.

## What This Skill Offers

This skill gives your AI coding tool comprehensive Swift Concurrency guidance. It can:

### Guide Your Concurrency Decisions
- Choose the right tool for the job (async/await, actors, tasks, task groups)
- Understand when to use `@MainActor`, custom actors, or `nonisolated`
- Navigate isolation domains and prevent data races at compile time
- Apply `Sendable` conformance correctly for value and reference types

### Write Safe Concurrent Code
- Avoid common pitfalls like actor reentrancy and retain cycles
- Prevent data races with proper isolation
- Handle task cancellation and error propagation correctly
- Manage memory safely in concurrent contexts

### Optimize Performance
- Choose between serialized, asynchronous, and parallel execution
- Reduce actor contention and unnecessary suspension points
- Understand the tradeoffs of parallelism

### Migrate to Swift 6
- Step-by-step migration strategies for existing codebases
- Enable strict concurrency checking incrementally
- Rewrite closure-based code to async/await
- Migrate from Combine/RxSwift to Swift Concurrency
- Use migration tooling for upcoming Swift features

### Test Concurrent Code
- Write reliable tests using Swift Testing (recommended) or XCTest
- Handle `@MainActor` isolation in tests
- Use `withMainSerialExecutor` for deterministic testing
- Avoid flaky tests with proper async handling

### Integrate with Core Data
- Safely pass data between isolation domains using `NSManagedObjectID`
- Implement the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern
- Use custom actor executors when needed
- Avoid common Core Data concurrency pitfalls

## What Makes This Skill Different

**Expert Knowledge**: Based on real-world experience migrating large production codebases to Swift 6, distilled from the comprehensive [Swift Concurrency Course](https://www.swiftconcurrencycourse.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=agent-skill&utm_campaign=swift-concurrency-skill).

**Non-Opinionated**: Focuses on industry-standard best practices and compile-time safety, not architectural preferences. Works with any Swift project, coding style, or architecture.

**Swift 6.2 Ready**: Covers the latest Swift Concurrency features including:
- Default Actor Isolation
- `isolated deinit`
- Global Actor Conformance for protocols
- `nonisolated(nonsending)` and `@concurrent`
- Approachable Concurrency build settings
- Concurrency-safe notifications (iOS 26+)

**Practical & Concise**: Assumes your AI agent is already smart. Focuses on what developers need to know, not what they already understand. Includes code examples for every pattern.
